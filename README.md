# Resume

This is my resume written in React! To run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
# then Ctrl + P in Google Chrome and 'Save as PDF'
```

## Acknowledgements

This project was forked from [clemmy](https://github.com/clemmy)'s [resume-react](https://github.com/clemmy/react-resume) project, so a special thanks to him!
